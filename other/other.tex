    \uline{In part due to the heavily abstract and philosophical nature of his work in mathematics, Alan Turing was reinterpreted by obituary writers by emphasizing his early work in computer science over his mathematical contributions, including his solution to the Entscheidungsproblem.}

    \uline{Alan Turing's work at Bletchley Park assigned him a focus on cryptography, which encouraged studies of and work in fields like computer science and engineering after the war. This experimentation in an area of applied math explains how he came to apply his experience in logic and analysis from before the Second World War to computer science and engineering. The advancement of cryptography was part of a larger pattern f the Second World War granting rapid progress to ideas which were rarely brought to prominence outside the urgency of a war.}
